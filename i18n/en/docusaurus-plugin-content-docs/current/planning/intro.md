## What is Act·in | SAC Planning?

**Planning and Budgeting Challenges**
- Usually there is no system available to formally carry out the economic planning cycle.
- Significant efforts are required, with a high propensity for human error and low capacity for managing **“macro variables”.**
- Management information is generated and distributed manually by creating Excel spreadsheets, which required significant effort.
- There is no single database that integrates and consolidates budgeted and actual information to perform comparisons, analysis, and management reports.
- Adapt quickly to market changes.

**Complete Planning Solution with Key Advantages:**
- Quick implementation
- Formalization of the budgeting cycle.
- Templates and Pre-calculated Indicators
